The onewordeachbot is a set of scripts set to run via crontab every 5 minutes or so. They track comments in the /r/onewordeach subreddit which intend to end sentence chains. The reply words are compiled and posted as a stickied spoiler-tagged comment. It uses the snoowrap Reddit API wrapper and Node.js package - https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap.
