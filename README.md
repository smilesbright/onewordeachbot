A bot for the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/onewordeach/

The onewordeachbot is a set of scripts set to run via crontab every 5 minutes or so. They track comments in the /r/onewordeach subreddit which intend to end sentence chains. The reply words are compiled and posted as a stickied spoiler-tagged comment.

It uses the 'snoowrap' Reddit API wrapper and npm package - https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap.

Many thanks to @not-an-aardvark.

Thanks as well to @mattdiamond, whose /r/askouija bot inspired the idea for /u/onewordeachbot - https://github.com/mattdiamond/ouijabot.
